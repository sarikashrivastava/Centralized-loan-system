<h3>Objective</h3>
<hr>
<p>In this technological era, our financial institutions have also shifted many of their tasks online which in turn has resulted in increased efficiency of work and peace of mind at both the customer and the officials end.</p>
<br>

<hr>
<h3> Problem Statement </h3>
<hr>
<p>The problem we have identified and are willing to work on is regarding loan application.</p>
</p>Though much of the loan procedure has been made digital still we -</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not have any centralized platform wherein we can check and apply for different bank loans according to our preference of lower interest or lower time.</li>
<li>There is also a lack of automation in the process of document verification which increases the loan time.</li>
<li>There is no one platform form all loan related interactions wherein the highest authority(bank manager) and the lowest authority(customer) could interact.</li>
<li>Many times the customer applying for the loan does not know the exact reason behind the loan rejection.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<hr>
<h3>Solution Uniqueness</h3>
<hr>
<p>The unique key features of our application are-</p>
<ol>
<li>The application is built keeping a user-centric approach where all the users(be it the customer, clerk or bank manager) are allocated separate dashboards to showcase all details at one go.</li>
<li>The centralized banking system which links all the banks and creates a one stop platform for loan management is a key factor to lookout.</li>
<li>We have taken care to have end to end data security and prevent documents from going misplaced and all the data is stored in encrypted form by using python code for encryption.</li>
<li>Each user registered on the website will be provided with an unique id from which he can apply to loans in various banks and would not require to create a new account.</li>
<li>We have tried to make the document verification task  as automised as possible.This will decrease the time taken for manual verification at the clerk and the manager end.</li>
<li>The software also has an inbuilt wallet system via which all transactions are handled.</li>
</ol>
